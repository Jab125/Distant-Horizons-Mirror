# fabric is broken due to an issue with their rendering event, issue link: https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/issues/4195
    # Iris/Sodium are also broken due to some Fabric/Architectury issue
        # attempting to activate either will throw the following error:
        # "Mod was built with a newer version of Loom (1.8.9), you are using Loom (1.7.414)"
        # IrisAccessor will need to be re-enabled when this is fixed
    # updating to fabric-loom 1.8 (and gradle-8.10) prevent building/cleaning in Intellij due to file locks
# forge is broken due to gradle/build script issues
